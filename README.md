Mass-Image-Hashing-Tool-For-NFT-Provenance

ABOUT
Mass Image Hashing Tool For NFT Provenance is developed to ease the process of building provenance for a NFT project. BTW you can use it for other purposes apart from NFT provenance. Hash thousands of NFT images within seconds, and get an concatenated hash and a final hash according to the starting index obtained from the smart contract. Provenance enhances the fair distribution of NFT tokens. ðŸ˜‡ HAPPY HASHING ðŸ¤ž

INFO
The provenance record of each NFT that will ever exist. Each NFT image is firstly hashed using SHA-256 algorithm. A combined string is obtained by concatenating SHA-256 of each NFT image in the specific order as listed below. The final proof is obtained by SHA-256 hashing this combined string. This is the final provenance record stored on the smart contract.
Each NFT token ID is assigned to an artwork image from the initial sequence with this formula
(tokenId + startingIndex) % 10000 â†’ Initial Sequence Index
